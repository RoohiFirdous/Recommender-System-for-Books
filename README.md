Book Recommendation System

ABSTRACT: The main objective of this project is to create a book recommendation system 
for users. Recommender systems play an important role in some industries as they can 
generate a huge amount of income when they are used effectively or also be a way to stand 
out significantly from competitors.

My project includes:

• Data Visualization Machine Learning

• Technologies- Python Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

• Books: Books are identified by their respective ISBN. Invalid ISBNs have already 
been removed from the dataset. Moreover, some content-based information is given 
(Book-Title, Book-Author, Year-Of-Publication, Publisher), obtained from Amazon 
Web Services. 

• Ratings: Contains the book rating information. Ratings are either explicit, expressed 
on a scale from 1-10 (higher values denoting higher appreciation), or implicit, 
expressed by 0.

• Users: User IDs have been anonymized and mapped to integers. Demographic data 
is provided (Location, Age) if available else these fields contain NULL values.

Description of the Project:

• Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on numerical and categorical data.

• Data Cleaning - Missing values handling and outlies identification

• Feature Selection - Used User-ID, ISBN and Books-Rating for model development.

• Model development - Tried Popularity based model and Collaborative filtering (Model 
based).

• Data exploration - data processing/cleaning recommendation system developer
