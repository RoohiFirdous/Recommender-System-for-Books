Book Recommendation System

ABSTRACT: The main objective of this project is to create a book recommendation system 
for users. Recommender systems play an important role in some industries as they can 
generate a huge amount of income when they are used effectively or also be a way to stand 
out significantly from competitors.

Designed and implemented a book recommendation system using machine learning and collaborative filtering techniques to
provide personalized book recommendations to users based on their reading preferences.

My project includes:

• Data Visualization Machine Learning

• Technologies- Python Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

• Books: Books are identified by their respective ISBN. Invalid ISBNs have already 
been removed from the dataset. Moreover, some content-based information is given 
(Book-Title, Book-Author, Year-Of-Publication, Publisher), obtained from Amazon 
Web Services. 

• Ratings: Contains the book rating information. Ratings are either explicit, expressed 
on a scale from 1-10 (higher values denoting higher appreciation), or implicit, 
expressed by 0.

• Users: User IDs have been anonymized and mapped to integers. Demographic data 
is provided (Location, Age) if available else these fields contain NULL values.

Description of the Project:

• Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on numerical and categorical data.

• Data Cleaning - Missing values handling and outlies identification

• Feature Selection - Used User-ID, ISBN and Books-Rating for model development.

• Model development - Tried Popularity based model and Collaborative filtering (Model 
based).

• Data exploration - data processing/cleaning recommendation system developer

Developed recommendation algorithm, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, to enhance the accuracy of book suggestions.

- Cleaned and preprocessed the book dataset to ensure data quality and consistency.
  
- Utilized Python, scikit-learn tools to build and deploy the recommendation system.
  
- Achieved an accuracy rate of 75% in predicting user preferences, resulting in a more effective recommendation system.
  
- Tools and Technologies: Python, scikit-learn
